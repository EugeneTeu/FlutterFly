# Flutter Fly
Hi, we are team CS Prayers. 
Help, the land of Flutter has been overrun with evil spiders. You play as a Flutterfly and your goal is to avoid the spiders.
In accordance with the theme of connecting the Flutter community, and easing the transition to flutter for new developers, we have decided to make an education game that provides a fun and interactive quiz-like experience to test concepts.
Our inspiration comes from Google's T-rex game on Google Chrome. If the player hits the spider, a multiple choice question appears that tests player's Flutter concepts and general knowledge. If they get the question correct, they are revived and can continue traversing the Flutter landscape, else the game is over.
For now, there are no questions available due to time constraints.
Enjoy!
